      <h2>About</h2>
      
      <p>At 16, I failed three dropshipping stores, then wrote <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Rise-Thrive-Creative-Guide-Entrepreneurs-ebook/dp/B0D787BPYH">a book</a> about it.</p>
      
      <p>At 17, I hosted <a href="https://luma.com/cornellec?k=c&period=past">weekly startup events</a> to 100+ people and offered free work to break in: design for two firms, code for one, PM for another.</p>
      
      <p>At 18, I left a hedge fund to do what I actually cared about, shipping product at three startups (listed above).</p>
      
      <p>At 19, I got over my fear of posting and now have over 100k views across platforms.</p>
